* Intractable problems to solve
** JUnit 5
+ Following the instruction at https://github.com/mannodermaus/android-junit5 leads to an unresolved class having to do
  with Jacoco.  If you have Android Studio 3.3 Canary 11 (or later) with Jacoco, Kotlin and Junit5, I'd love to see your
  build scripts.
